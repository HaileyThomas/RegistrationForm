# Registration Form ðŸ“ƒ
## Description
- I wanted to create a small project to practice form creation and css.
- I thought a faux registration form would be an excellent way to practice and had a lot of fun creating it.
- The form currently doesn't work but in the future I plan to add some javascript so there is an event that happens on click, and to fix the checkbox feature.
